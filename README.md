# lab6

Honestly, I didn't understand what I have to do in this lab, so I just launched scripts from the matlab with my robot from lab 5.


lab5.m is my original file for lab5 with minor changes.

create_dataset_fk.m, train_fk.m, demo_fk.m - versions of the provided scripts corrected to fit the dimensions of my robot.
